# CDL-Crosshair-Installer
## Description
Makes adding images or image sets to Custom-Desktop-Logo easier.

## How To Setup a .ZIP for Installation
To make a .ZIP with the image files, install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) and select the files in your folder then select whichever option for either program that compresses the files.
If you do compress a folder, then the images will not be found by **CustomDesktopLogo**.

## CLI Is Supported
To use the ***cli***, enter the arguments like this (both are optional, but the image set must be entered first if you want to use the second argument):<br/><br/>
Syntax: `"<IMAGE_SET_PATH>" -clean`

Rules:
  * `IMAGE_SET_PATH`: The file path to your .ZIP file.
  * `-clean`: Specifies that the program must delete the original archive file after extracting the contents to the **Images** folder.
